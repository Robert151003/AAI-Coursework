The model uses the function provided by the **`PyTorch.nn`** package, and consists of 4 layers: (i) Convolutional; (ii) Pooling; (iii) Activation; (iv) Fully connected. The convolutional layer aims to extract key features and patterns from the input data (Deep Learning on Edge Computing Devices, 2022). The pooling layer is responsioble for reducing the spatial dimensions of the input data (dremio, n.d). The activation layer enables the model to recognise and learn complex patterns in the input data (Ali, 2024). The fully connected layer connects all the nodes in one layer to all the nodes in another layer (GeeksForGeeks, 2024). The **`forward()`** function determines the data flow through the CNN, and specifies how the input data moves through each of these layers."
